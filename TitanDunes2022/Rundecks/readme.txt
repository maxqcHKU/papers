This folder contains the rundeck ".R" files used to compile and run the four sensitivity tests for the Titan ROCKE-3D GCM model. File paths for some input files in the rundecks will need to be changed accordingly. The "Start Up" folder contains the start up rundecks used for the initial 10-year run ups and a 20-year run up rundeck for the flat (FL) Titan run. File names refer to the simulation they represent (FL - Flat, WT - With Topography, Z0 - With Surface Roughness Variability, WTZ0 - With Topography and Surface Roughness Variability).
